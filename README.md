# SIC-mini-project
This project is a Smart Home Gate built using IoT components. The system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect vehicles, a camera to capture license plate numbers, and a servo motor to automatically open or close the gate. LEDs and a buzzer give clear signals for authorized or unauthorized entry. Data is also sent to Blynk for monitoring and remote control.

The project aims to make home gates smarter, safer, and more convenient, while also providing a base for future upgrades like real-time camera processing for license plate recognition.
